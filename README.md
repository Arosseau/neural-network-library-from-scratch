# Deep learning framework from scratch
Creating my own neural network/deep learning framework from scratch in python to fully understand the principles behind them. I use numpy for the matrix transformations.

## Functionalities
Basic functionalities only for now; solves the MNIST classification problem (and similar problems) well!

### Main NeuralNetwork class
   - Inference
   - Training:
      - Epochs
      - (Mini-)batches
      - Backpropagation
      - SGD      

### Initializers:
  - Random
  - He
  
### Layers:
  - Input layer
  - Dense layer
(output layers implicit)

### Loss functions:
  - Cross-entropy
  - MSE
  
### Optimizers:
  - SGD (batch or mini-batch) with one learning-rate for now
  
### Activation functions:
  - Softmax
  - ReLU
  - Identity
